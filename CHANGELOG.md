# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Added de-identified public fixtures under `example_data/public/` for documentation and smoke testing (`DEMO_IN_NGS*`, `DEMO_PRRT_NGS*`, `DEMO_COMBO_NGS*`).
- Added import/API stability tests for installed-package behavior (`import hyrise`, `__version__`, curated top-level exports).
- Added public fixture privacy guard tests to prevent reintroducing identifying sample tokens.

### Changed

- Made `questionary` a default runtime dependency so interactive mode works with plain `pip install hyrise`.
- Updated MultiQC requirement to `>=1.33` and updated container build definitions to use `1.33`.
- Updated package version to `0.2.0`.
- Replaced bundled HIVdb XML from `HIVDB_9.8.xml` to `HIVDB_10.1.xml`.
- Updated Sierra default XML handling to select the latest bundled `HIVDB_*.xml` instead of a hardcoded XML filename.
- Updated package data rules to include `HIVDB_*.xml` (sdist/wheel future-proofing).
- Updated README for CLI-first usage, de-identified example commands, explicit Python API guidance, and container workflows for pip-installed users.
- Updated CI smoke job to validate installed-wheel imports (`import hyrise`, `from hyrise import *`) and packaged container asset extraction.

### Fixed

- Fixed HIVdb XML version resolution to use numeric version comparison (`10.1` > `9.9`) rather than lexical filename ordering.
- Removed hardcoded `HIVDB_9.8.xml` references across CLI help/defaults.
- Improved local GitLab pipeline behavior by skipping dind-only jobs in `gitlab-ci-local` emulation where service DNS/health checks are unreliable.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-04-22

### Features

- Added report customization, updated CICD pipeline, added automatic change log generation, updated styling code for the HTML generation, added more testing. ([a594426](a5944261f3ca8de242645dbb21954cd6aeefced1))
